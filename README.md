Mother Goose Board Game Project
- For Java Bootcamp my first weekassignment was to similate the board game
- Make sure player stands on stone 1 at the start of every game
- Game ends when player landed exactly on stone 63, and game restarts (back on stone 1 again)
- If landed on stone 6, go immediately to stone 12
- Landed on 42, go back to 39
- Landed on 58, go all the way back to 1 again
- On every landing, inform whether player is safe or not
